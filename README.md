## Sets on obtaining a Yelp API Key

## Change from AllProjects to DependencyResolutionManagement
From Gradle version 6.8 and up, `allProjects` block is not required to list repositories. Instead list them in the project-level `settings.gradle.kts`. If you attempt to add an allProjects block in your gradle file, Gradle will throw an error if dependencyResolutionManagement is present
in the project-level `settings.gradle.kts`.
